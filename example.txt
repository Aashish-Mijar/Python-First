Everythings that fades looks beautiful.
When wind of changes blow some build walls and some build windmill.
Courage is not the absence of fear but conquest of fear
There is no greater sorrow than to recall happiness in times of misery.
He who has felt the deepest grief is best able to experience supreme happiness.
Every man has his secret sorrows which the world knows not.
Tears are the silent language of grief.
Life is made of so many partings welded together.
Life itself is the most wonderful fairy tale.
